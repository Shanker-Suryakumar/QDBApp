# QDBApp
QDB app is a sample app with dashboard and blogs screen with some posts related informations. 

This task was actually implemented based on the web page app requirements.
The web task is modified and similar android app is created with dashboard, blogs & details functionalities.

Unit testing yet to be implemented for user name.
Able to read the base url from "url.env" file created & available under assets folder but not used in app since it requires some more handling.
